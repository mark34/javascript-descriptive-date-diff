#A very simple js file to provide a textual description of the difference between 2 dates.

I'm not primarily a js coder, so I wanted something very simple that has no dependencies, and does the job reliably.
I was amazed that I couldn't find anything that did the job I wanted, so I quickly wrote the code for myself. 
The code is based on an answer I saw on stackoverflow.com to a question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763327/how-to-calculate-date-difference-in-javascript by user : https://stackoverflow.com/users/198062/murat-Ã‡orlu

##What it does

- take 2 js Date objects
- return an object containing years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds
- the object also has convenience methods: toString() and toArray() 
- you can limit the detail, so you get only months, weeks, days or whatever. 

##to use: 

Get a string representation:
```
var diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528123372000) );
// describe the difference fully
console.log( diffObject.toString() );
// describe the difference, only using the major 4 interval types
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 4} ) );
// describe the difference using only the broadest interval type
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) );
```


Manually generate your own string representation:
```
var diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528123372000) );
// describe the difference fully
console.log( diffObject.toArray().join(' and ' );
// describe the difference, only using the major 4 interval types
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 4} ) );
// describe the difference using only the broadest interval type
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) );
```
