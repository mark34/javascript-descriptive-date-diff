# A very simple js file to provide a textual description of the difference between 2 dates.

I'm not primarily a js coder, so I wanted something very simple that has no dependencies, and does the job reliably.
I was amazed that I couldn't find anything that did the job I wanted, so I quickly wrote the code for myself. 
The code is based on an answer I saw on stackoverflow.com to a question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763327/how-to-calculate-date-difference-in-javascript by user : https://stackoverflow.com/users/198062/murat-Ã‡orlu

## What it does

- take 2 js Date objects
- return an object containing years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds
- the object also has convenience methods: toString() and toArray() 
- you can limit the detail, so you get only months, weeks, days or whatever. 

For example, from the example.html page :

```

First example: 2018-06-13 18:03:08 and 2018-06-04 14:42:52

diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528123372000) );
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) = 1 week
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 4} ) = 1 week, 2 days, 20 minutes, 16 seconds


Second example: 2020-02-01 04:21:10 and 2018-06-04 14:42:52

diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1580530870000), new Date(1528123372000) )
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) = 1 year
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 3} ) = 1 year, 7 months, 4 weeks
diffObject.toString() = 1 year, 7 months, 4 weeks, 1 day, 38 minutes, 18 seconds


Third example: 2018-06-13 18:03:08 and 2018-06-13 19:01:02

diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528916462000) )
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) = 57 minutes
diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 30} ) = 57 minutes, 54 seconds
diffObject.toString() = 57 minutes, 54 seconds

Join the elements yourself:
diffObject.toArray({'maxDetail':2}).join(' and ') = 57 minutes and 54 seconds

```

The diffObject generates an interval in terms of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.     

The idea is that you write the whole lot out as a description;     

The interval is expressed as **N years, and N months and N weeks and N days, N hours and N minutes and N seconds.**
 

## to use: 

Get a string representation:
```
var diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528123372000) );
// describe the difference fully
console.log( diffObject.toString() );
// describe the difference, only using the major 4 interval types
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 4} ) );
// describe the difference using only the broadest interval type
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) );
```


Manually generate your own string representation:
```
var diffObject = makeDifferenceObject( new Date(1528912988000), new Date(1528123372000) );
// describe the difference fully
console.log( diffObject.toArray().join(' and ' );
// describe the difference, only using the major 4 interval types
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 4} ) );
// describe the difference using only the broadest interval type
console.log( diffObject.toString( {'maxDetail': 1} ) );
```
